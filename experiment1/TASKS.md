- Tool that learns to build html forms
XD
OMG
LIKE INSTEAD OF TEMPLATING
IT UM KNOWS
ABOUT THE UNIVERSE
THAT ALLOWS FORMS
AND CONSTRUCTS A VALID FORM FROM THAT UNIVERSE

THEN:
WEIGHTED TO OUR LIKING

WHY IS THIS USEFUL TO LEARN:
TBH I dont think it is until its more general in the implementation of the solutions machine code that you gain such a performance inc/workflow inc/x ... yadayada

Its cool because "you could apply it to other languages"
yet... "FORM UNIVERSE" -> <FORM>, 1.2 FORMS (spec), N => Text => N => Spec => Form => N => Human => Me => My perspective => N ????????

well anyways, lets plop in "another languge" -> C++
... no forms.

So learning forms is really:
1. learning what our concept of a form is
2. learning toolchains what deliver useable forms
3. building them

So what is "learning just enough html to build a valid form using machine learning instead of
- hardcoding
- lookup table
- rules
- compiler
- syntax checker
"?

"what if not 100% verifiable"? probably fine for ML

Bigger picture:
Iterate reallllllllly quickly on polished designs

1. Machine learning
- I like this approach because of the idea that your coding systems that can code for themselves
- This is great because then you can move on from ever coding a form again
- Would you still need to design forms again?
- Can we bridge that gap to designing like pen on paper, introducing color, using novel color tools to apply that color, synthesize color from swatches, 
  scrape the web for swatches of real sites that are of #sometag and apply those, introduce content and format it?
- Basically I guess what I'm asking is what do we want web design to be like?
- Then beyond that? What do we want video hosing to be like? If I want to "let users upload videos and share them"?
- How can the machine analyze: current video algorithms, average sizes, weights, infratrstructure, hosting, deployments, bandwidth, processing, user behaviour, etc,
  and build out the feature that satisfies our budget, max users, delivery goals, quality standards, latency standards, availability?
- I mean at that point the SW is really in the users hands finally; but is this the best way to get there?
- like troughing through these technologies? designed by humans?
- If we're going to learn it all, and have to eventually learn what it means to be a connected computer ??? just to build a website for some guy that wants it red but red like THAT not THIS
- WHY NOT learn it AS the machine, let it do its thing by its own learned means to its capabilities to build towards a website, or ultimately a pleasurable mechanism of communication
  - its efficient, effective, accurate, up to date, flexible, able to explain to a 5 year old (perspectives)

2. GUI based programming / visual compiler toolchain
3. Templates
4. Libraries
5. Expert knowledge / Expert code
6. Google searches
7. Prebuilt templates

So....

WHAT DO BRO
HTML spec != some other spec
???
learn spec stuffs...
learn english -> spec -> writing -> influence/review -> editing -> packaging


Tutorial be like:
1. See dis --> "WOW" <---
2. Do dis 1. 2. 3.
3. See --> "WOW" <---

how?
how involves imagination
dreaming?
other pespectives?

Img to form is redic cause like if your talking design theres the INTERPRETATION OF WHAT IT IS TO BE A FORM, dun dunnn dunnn...
ARE THOSE PIXELS EVEN INPUTS
IS DAT BUTTON ASSOCIATED WITH THIS INPUT OR THAT INPUT
DO DAT BUTTON EVEN DO
DAT EVEN BE DEY?
EVENT?
WAT?

How do we know something is a button before we reeeeally know its a button?
- It can say button
- It looks like a button
- It behaves like a button
- It is button - we clicked it yay! it did something!
- OK and so thats a button but is that a button or anchor or just the number 5 or "go to the home screen" or "put on the news"
- So maybe a button is an action?
- Ok so we're beginning to visualize exactly it is where up to here
- HUMAN COMPUTER INTERACTION
- Are websites the answer?
- So why not let the computer run its realm
- Humans run our realm I GUESS
- And then meet in the middle

-- JUST IDEAS AT SOME SPUR OF THE MOMENT
- Adoption, availability, complexity, competition, war, game theory, protocols, how come things are the way they are, efficiency, for each dependency -> back to Adoption at start of list
- Then like at this point its like well, shit, may as well look at the biological implementation of the the problems we're trying to solve because fuck me right?
- I'm going to shit out some algo that can beat the performance and capabilities of an organmism thats existed since X TIME
- I mean butterflies cant drive cars but sub problems
- So then its like well ok ok ok this is the GOOD GOOD right here
- So its like how do we model those implementations to understand them right?
- We have to travel through them and be like - IS THIS A BUTTON? oops no its a blood cell
- So then rather than US travelling through them - THIS IS THE GOOD - have SOME THING travel through them
- That can continuously exist within the space time and report back for a particular query efficiently
- So kinda like spawning a universe you can never see whats inside?
- But you can talk to it at its spawn point maybe anyways
  - Check out more quantum, physics, partical physics -> microscopes, space light freq stuff, telescope, measurements, problems/paper that build off of specific empircal result to something theoretical

-> Something that could learn something for me then respond to queries, answer questions, back up their facts (tell a convincing story), teach me, explain something using metaphors, build stuff <-
  -- WOULD BE AMAZING
*********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

So for HTML FORMS: "Something that could learn something for me then respond to queries, answer questions, back up their facts (tell a convincing story), teach me, explain something using metaphors, build stuff"
- What does this mean?
  - Take a variant of the HTML spec that pertains to forms and all its dependencies
  - Learn and understand the spec
  - Take a list of target browsers/versions
  - Understand their projected capabilities for each spec
  - Produces content in an industry standard and intrepretable way
  - Produces content that is valid within the selected spec and capabilities and browsers

Legit with english and all its visual deps or like in a hacky clever most efficient ever way?
Which level of the tortoise loop?

The level where I can write it, its maintainable, and approachable, begins workly more quickly than not (test wise, practically), and is done sooner than later ... XD XD XD
So.....
Are those the "real reqs"?

HTML FORMS
  - Take a variant of the HTML spec that pertains to forms and all its dependencies
  - Learn and understand the spec
  - Take a list of target browsers/versions
  - Understand their projected capabilities for each spec
  - Produces content in an industry standard and interpretable way
  - Produces content that is valid within the selected spec and capabilities and browsers

- How do I direct this production?
- OH GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD COULD YOU IMAGINE CONVERSATION ASYNC TASK BASED AUTOMATIC APPLICATION BUILDERS SO BSICALLY THEN THEY COULD ANSEER MQYUES QUEQSUAIFDFHJNTS?
- AND DOOO LIKE ALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL MY DIGITAL TASKS
- LIKE ALL MY WORK OMGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG WHATS UP BRUH
- I SWEAR ILL GO OUTSIDE WHEN I GET THIS DONE CAUSE THEN LIKE WHOAH

- CAN I PLEASE HAVE A PANEL OF EXPERTS?
- How should I invest my money? go
- How should I pay my bills? go
- How should I ...

- but with someone so knowledgeable (say every single google search result)
- the data needs to be refined
- so now the PC needs to ask you questions and KNOW you and get YOUR perspective and |your_perspective:data| <-basically_a_wormhole-> |computer_data|
- $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ break of monetizable chunks - feed the dream
- FUCKIN SIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIICK
- + VR goggles or something and some animated dude = synthesized tutorials on demand
- Then it keeps snowballing so the assistant gets to know you, when to use what kind of visual aid, trying new ones
  - Can ask to try new ones
  - Increase times things are newer or different
  - Or ACTUALLY JUST CHANGE HOW YOU TALK TO THE ASSISTANT
    - Change you perspective and it changes with you
    - You could ask it - how can I change my perspective? what are some books? read to me? run through some youtube playlists at 33x speed
    - Hold these n items up for review / history
    - It needs to learn how to do these personal tasks
    - You need to be able to influence it
      - iOS shortcuts

- Voice? Speaking? Conversation?
- JSON?
- Picture?
- Photoshop?
- Pool of images?
- Scraping? + searching/applying those results
- Drag drop? I like drag drop
  - You have to drag and drop the photoshop anyways...
  - Could combine PS + live save / reload
- Picture is more cool cause drag and drop be like
  - Well now these are just sliders for values in a picture that is hardcoded to invoke a function that builds (still open!) a select box
  - Eh nbd closed: influence a part of the production as a director (drag/drop=location, color pickers, thicknesses, property discovery, orchestration)
    - open: generation of implementation of location, style assignment, pickers, orchestration
- Discovered new levels: spacing, layout, picture != screen on device
- Anyways since we're talking websites and its not yet the ultimate assistant lets do a photoshop style thing?
- God build me a form would be so cool
- Hey codemob build me a form. I want to capture [category] details
  - [category] - attempt to prefill data and associated collection mechanisms??? lol!!!!! for real though -> mapped, specced + map, specced english, specced english perspectified, AHHHHHHH
  - Possibly generate form and present
  - Ok do you want to capture first and last for person?
  - Yeah
  - I want to modify person first make it bold .....
  - Hmm mapping of visaul art to paper has been done by hand with pencil, computer tools, art theory, photography, color
  - So maybe a photoshop site thing is better
- Voice is cool to start or iterate or prototype designs so maybe thats better for this type of quick tool :p
- For detailed surfaces, curves, waves, etc, what do you say? I want a purple wave over here rotated 30% with some spacing between the valleys?
- Then we're at a different technology :D

#IN ORDER OF ML PROBLEMS
# LEARN REQUIREMENTS
# LEARN HOW TO BUILD A FORM
# LEARN HOW MEET REQUIREMENTS

iOS shortcuts
canva
yahoo pipes
...1970s, 80s,
super powered ios shortcuts
excel but more gui
just a UX thing? simple as hiding the detail of what an API is? or a an API key? and saying here you go heres a datasource your creds are 100% underneath? your chris?
but then who codes that right?
to what degree of verifiability? back to: IS THIS A BUTTON? WHATS A BUTTON?

button: people say hey use this button to represent "do this action" "enter this value" "probably some other more obscure states"
- an action requires a context
- a value requires a context
- a mode is a kind of context probably
- this is nuts WHAT NATURAL GAMES EXIST we're saying, ahaha MANUALLY, we're saying, DO THIS OR THAT OR MAYBE THIS DEPENDING ON THE STATE OF THE APP WHICH IS BASICALLY THE UNIVERSE
- and we're manually plucking the chords of the universe until its to our liking
  -- shouldwe pluck away
  -- sew
  -- make a magic ball that does it for us
- if if you go outside and see like bees, bears, flowers, lions, birds, trees, water, weather, these patterns of things
- you see conciousness in nature through these animals, maybe even the higher interplay of the weather systems itself has some meaning to itself or percection who knows
- and so you dont see like ok how do I put this tree together, the tree IS together
- and you dont see how do I make honey, or bees pondering the latest in honey trends in english (maybe in bee talk), but you see it play over the levels of relationships between the structures of the organisms
- and so we're at a level were we can see something, and quite deeply I guess, but in everday like I see dust, stars, moon, sun, elephants, telephone poles, daughter, dogs, phones, cheese
- I guess I see systems interface like bird landing in a puddle, and hearing cars go down the road
- But in this entire interplay I have not really put anything together other than I think thats a car most likely it could be a truck, is that the same thing? depends on the person and able to think about all that in a way to pose a question about it in an effort to build software that mimics that behavior in order to move unnaturally fast through a series of ideas and build them out
- So I guess these programs could build their own programs and I dont know at which point it decides to say ok well, lets build the thing that is a part of the real program
**************************************************************************************************
- And thats the shadow DOM of quantum physics yo
- Basically a pool of space that can realize a presence/product/manifestation based on the ineractions at play at a specific point in its geometry
  -- thereby SEVERELY reducing the computational load and requirements of such a system
  -- but probably losing something at the same time like: the whole system can never be travelled, or at some point things become fixed, variety is lost, and can no longer realize
    -- beep program over
  -- things are unreal/ "real numbers"
    -- everything is a never ending traversal through the graph that is life and never or take forever to fully resolve
    -- it resolves quickly because it uses the latest reference frame, which would be memoized?
    -- and wouldnt need those past frames?
    -- but???
- So is that neural net?
- Or is there another structure?
**************************************************************************************************

- Just build something useful, truly reliable, practically usable

- I want to be able to find inspiration
- I want to be able to choose the level of that I'm designing at
  -- Fully functioning, customize
  -- Template
  -- Sidebar layout
  -- Component layout
  -- Border
  -- Padding
-- And get inspiration at that level
- I want to apply styles - manipulate the levers of the html/css/js/x spec
- I want to build and test interactions quickly, run through them as mocked users, 10, 100, 1000, N mocked users, good data, bad data, real services
- Replay any tests I personally make
- Fuzz and automate as much meaningful testing as possible
- Define verfiability and meet it
  - Design
  - Side effects from other design changes

***************************************************************************************************************************************************
- I want it to do things I don't know how to do (maybe not even describe) and efficiently!
***************************************************************************************************************************************************
- Does this mean we are bound to tools that can only help with things we've done already?
- Or can tools build from our ideas?
- So a conversation is important because you need to pick something and begin iterating

- Level of detail
- Inspiration
- conversation

- What about code that generates libraries? learns how to make FFI calls for all the APIs makes a sweet API for them?

-- Honestly if we stop incepting this system, let it loose, and just give it goals to meet we are going to see some hilarious implementations of sites that are like
  -- weird ascii chars cause that was somehow more efficient
- And yet this thing needs to travel those paths to say ok what is the space of efficiency? what can I work with? whats in reach? back to: when do they decide ok this is good enough?
  -- when the sub problem solution meets the requirements and has no side effects that make it impossible to meet the requirements of other sub problems
    -- so by definition unrealizable with a calculatable time?

SO
How do we leverage this fuzzy graph data structure to build something that is fully unrealizable but verifiable from a particular perspective/space/point?
- "We don't know what it's going to say. But each time we ask it it seems to give us the right answer."
- "Can I see the part of your universe labeled https://www.foodtron9000.com/signup?

Since I'm not developing the site anymore... do I let it choose all the tech?
What if it chooses like HTML4 and ajax or some MS extension...
What if all that is compatible with what I asked for?
Would it matter?
What if it worked?
What if it didn't?
How do we know where it won't? XD WELL WED HAVE TO BE IN THE OTHER USERS COMPUTER BATTER HARDWARE CIRCRUITS
Bounding ideas like that is really hard. Is there a tool for that?

1. Choose a machine learning algorithm.
